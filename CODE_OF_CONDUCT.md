# Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct is simple: treat everyone with respect, kindness, and empathy.
We promote collaboration and open communication, ensuring all feel valued and supported.
Treat others as you would want others to treat you and your children:
with fairness, patience, and understanding, creating an environment where all can thrive.
